The sentences are in the "sentences" sheet. It's protected so that you don't accidentally enter your scores there. Make a copy of the Google sheets spreadsheet in your own Google drive or download a copy. Once you have completed scoring, save your spreadsheet in the folder as "sentences_XX" with your initials for "XX".

Assign every sentence a sentiment score between -4 and 4, where 0 is neutral, i.e., just stating a fact with no sentiment. Whole numbers only. Positive numbers indicate positive sentiment and negative numbers negative sentiment, specifically with respect to the topic at hand. Clearly unrelated sentences have been removed, but not every sentence has a direct relationship to incarceration. That is ok.
